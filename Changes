v0.4.2

    * Bugfix: .duplicate() operates on the tag node rather than the root node of

    * Fix a broken test.
    * Rename META.info to META6.json
    * Fixed the license

v0.4.0

    * COMPATABILITY BREAKING CHANGE: Formats are now specified using a class
      name, such as DOM, HTML, and XML. Using a format name like "html" or "xml"
      will no longer work.
    * COMPATIBILITY  BREAKING CHANGE: Custom formats are built using format
      classes rather than using a custom multi sub, which worked poorly in some
      circumstances.

v0.3.2
    
    * Corrected problems documentation on custom format extensions.
    * Fixed minor bugs related to custom extensions.

v0.3.1

    * Experimental change to make the modified DOM and formatter available for
      subclassing.

v0.3

    * Previously, template objects were reused as-is every time. This meant that
      each subsequent run built on previous modifications to the original.
      Not cool.

    * Complete rewrite.
    * Uses DOM::Tiny now rather than XML.
    * Structures the templates into libraries of templates.
    * Provides some basic facilities for locating original source files.

v0.1

    * Initial experimental release.
